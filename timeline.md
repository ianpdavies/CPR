# Timeline for graduation

---

### End of Fall Quarter 2019 = Dec 6 (end of instruction) / Dec 13 (end of finals)

That's 84 days (2 months + 24 days) from Sep 12, 2019.

Final product:
 * Written thesis
 * Results for flood estimation algorithm
 
Things I want to have done to graduate:
 * Experimental results from the model on multiple floods events, in multiple geographies, and under different cloud conditions
 * Evidence of whether a flood-agnostic (FA) or flood-specific (FS) model is better
  * Performance metrics on the same flood events
 * Understanding what data are most important for predicting flood extent
  * Retrieving feature importance from model
  
Steps to achieve these goals:
 * Experimental results
  1. Collect more flood imagery
  2. Run model on floods
  3. Create visualizations
 * FA vs. FS
  1. Train model on many floods and predict on a cloudy test set from other flood events

 ## Master plan
 
 1. Run FS model on the flood images I have, see what needs to be tweaked
 2. Collect more flood imagery
 3. Run optimized FS model on more imagery
 4. Visualize results

**If time permits**
 5. Train a FA model on train set, then test
 6. Compare to FS model
