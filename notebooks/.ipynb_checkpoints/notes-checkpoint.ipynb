    "### Algorithm\n",
    " - Need to learn more about tuning hyperparameters for SVM\n",
    " - Feature extraction/engineering. What are important characteristics of the features? How do tell which features are important and which can be removed?\n",
    " - Should I stratify sampling equally? 50/50 flood/nonflood? Or should the % of flood/nonflood pixels be preserved?\n",
    " - Is accuracy a good metric? It's probably fine when stratified sampling so the dataset is balanced (50/50 flood/nonflood) but if we wanted to search over clouds in real images where flooding is quite rare, might want to maximize another metric like recall or precision\n",
    "     - Alternatives: balanced accuracy, recall, precision\n",
    " - http://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/\n",
    "  - https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/30930/accuracy-and-loss-dont-change-in-cnn-is-it-over-fitting\n",
    "  - Try using ReLu instead of tanh in CNN\n",
    " \n",
    "### CNN\n",
    " - Need to shuffling data before splitting into train/validation so it's \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    " - Should remove GSW_MaxExtent because the classifier might just be predicting based on that binary variable.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge cases\n",
    " - Does the machine do better with large gaps than many smaller gaps?\n",
    " \n",
    "### Function\n",
    " - Should ideally just have one long function in GEE that can handle different cases - when we input just one event (feature) or multiple (feature collection). Can add a conditional, that way we don't have to repeat as much code.\n",
    " - Should we include both GSW perm and max extent? Definitely mask flooded with perm, but maybe the distExtent is catching some of the flooding? \n",
    " - We do need to calculate features over watersheds because otherwise some of the distExtent values will be incorrect\n",
    "     - Currently (not sure if this is because of calculating only for image extent) distExtent is returning huge impossible values of 2147483648\n",
    " - If memory becomes an issue, consider changing bands back to int once they are in array.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Problems\n",
    " - Something is happening when I export the images that have been masked by clouds - The non-cloudy areas should be null or NA, but instead the export image contains all values in the clip region as if from the entire image.\n",
    "     - One solution might be to update mask but make the masked values all null or NoData\n",
    "     - Solution to add -999999 to pixels I want to be no data, then removing those when converting data to sparse matrix in Python\n",
    " - BQA/pixel_qa bands in L8: They are smaller than the other bands, leaving gaps on the edges that are filled with zeroes when I export the image. This messes up all the features, esp. the flooded layer because it is binary and zeroes have meaning\n",
    "     - Posted on SE and Developer Forum.\n",
    "     - BQA problem: https://code.earthengine.google.com/71c60311da2029fd647bf86f6595037d\n",
    "     - pixel_qa is the correct size sometimes: https://code.earthengine.google.com/6393d7232b5ba4540245efa2c85c1242\n",
    "         - But pixel_qa shows the same small extent problem when I use it in my sampling function. It's definitely pixel_qa band, because flooded turns out fine.\n",
    "             - However, there is no problem when I mask a TOA image with a SR pixel_qa mask here, outside of the sampling function: https://code.earthengine.google.com/dd74749034d1d660514f098017173875. What is happening in the sampler function to make this issue appear?\n",
    "     - Problem appears to be with the getLandsatImages function. See: https://code.earthengine.google.com/845fcf316b23e9b1ff7cc06f50513041. Flooded2 layer is used with just a regular ee.ImageCollection call to TOA, flooded1 uses the getLandsatImages function\n",
    "     - Actually nevermind, when I set the date range, cloud cover, and bounds the same as the getLandsatImages call, both flooded1 and flooded2 are small. So, this appears to be a problem with some L8 images and not others? https://code.earthengine.google.com/8e44f6f71a544d98c0493d8d17bacec9\n",
    "     - I think for now, masking the output image of features with the QA masks and then unmasking with -999999 allows me to sort out the issue in Python by removing these no data values. \n",
